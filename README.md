# ISDP-an overview

The ISDP initiative was established to evaluate human resilience and mental well-being under challenging conditions, maintaining a steadfast commitment to our objectives. My resolve remains unshaken in the face of adversity.

This Integrated System Design and Project for MEng students at University of Glasgow was undertaken across both semesters for the academic year 2023-24 in our 4th Year of Engineering studies. This project brought together 6 different engineering students from different engineering academic studies to undertake a collaborative project focusing on an entrepreneurial engineering solution to a problem. 

The team members of this project and their respective field of studies are :

* Tamim Abdul Maleque - Electronics and Electrical Engineering
* Mariya Christudas Haris - Civil Engineering with Architecture
* Nemish Laddad - Mechanical Design Engineering
* Alejandra Paja Garcia - Biomedical Engineering
* Tarik Pinaffo Almeida - Aerospace Engineering
* Alex Smith - Aeronautical Engineering

Clean Currents is our company providing a solution to cleaning the waterways, particularly the rivers using a robotic technology solution.
